  abstract = "Rabies has been eliminated from domestic dog populations in
              Western Europe and North America, but continues to kill many
              thousands of people throughout Africa and Asia every year. A
              quantitative understanding of transmission dynamics in domestic
              dog populations provides critical information to assess whether
              global elimination of canine rabies is possible. We report
              extensive observations of individual rabid animals in Tanzania
              and generate a uniquely detailed analysis of transmission
              biology, which explains important epidemiological features,
              including the level of variation in epidemic trajectories. We
              found that the basic reproductive number for rabies, R0, is very
              low in our study area in rural Africa (approximately 1.2) and
              throughout its historic global range (<2). This finding provides
              strong support for the feasibility of controlling endemic canine
              rabies by vaccination, even near wildlife areas with large wild
              carnivore populations. However, we show that rapid turnover of
              domestic dog populations has been a major obstacle to successful
              control in developing countries, thus regular pulse vaccinations
              will be required to maintain population-level immunity between
              campaigns. Nonetheless our analyses suggest that with sustained,
              international commitment, global elimination of rabies from
              domestic dog populations, the most dangerous vector to humans, is
              a realistic goal.",

              and genomic data provides new opportunities to reveal the
              spatiotemporal dynamics of infectious diseases and determine the
              processes responsible for their spread and maintenance. Taking
              advantage of detailed epidemiological time series and viral
              sequence data from more than 20 years reported by the National
              Reference Centre for Rabies of Bangui, the capital city of
              Central African Republic, we used a combination of mathematical
              modeling and phylogenetic analysis to determine the
              spatiotemporal dynamics of rabies in domestic dogs as well as the
              frequency of extinction and introduction events in an African
              city. We show that although dog rabies virus (RABV) appears to be
              endemic in Bangui, its epidemiology is in fact shaped by the
              regular extinction of local chains of transmission coupled with
              the introduction of new lineages, generating successive waves of
              spread. Notably, the effective reproduction number during each
              wave was rarely above the critical value of 1, such that rabies
              is not self-sustaining in Bangui. In turn, this suggests that
              rabies at local geographic scales is driven by human-mediated
              dispersal of RABV among sparsely connected peri-urban and rural
              areas as opposed to dispersion in a relatively large homogenous
              urban dog population. This combined epidemiological and genomic
              approach enables development of a comprehensive framework for
              understanding disease persistence and informing control measures,
              indicating that control measures are probably best targeted
              towards areas neighbouring the city that appear as the source of
              frequent incursions seeding outbreaks in Bangui.",
